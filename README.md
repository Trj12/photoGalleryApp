## Technical requirements

- Mock the data and create API layer using axios or isomorphic-fetch libraries to retrieve the mocked data.

- Organize the data flow using Redux. Dispatch some actions to retrieve the data and store the data, coming from API calls, in the Redux stores

- Show photo thumbs in the single page. The page should be responsive.

- Allow the user to select a photo by clicking on it and then open a popup to show the photo with original size and with some description.

- Inside the popup the user has ability to add some comment. If the user adds some comment it should be saved in the Redux store by dispatching proper actions inside the component.
